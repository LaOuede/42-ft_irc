<h1 align=center>ft_irc</h1>

<div align="center">

The <b>ft_irc</b> project involves the implementation of an Internet Relay Chat (IRC) server and client.
The purpose is to create a scalable and efficient server that can handle multiple clients concurrently.
The project encompasses features such as channel creation, private messaging, and handling various IRC commands,
fostering a comprehensive understanding of networking, system calls, and inter-process communication.

<h3 align="left">What I've learned ðŸ“š</h3>

I've acquired basic knowledge in :
- <b>Internet Relay Chat (IRC) Protocol</b>: Understanding the IRC protocol, including its commands, message formats, and server-client interactions.
- <b>Networking Protocols</b>: Knowledge of TCP/IP networking protocols, including how data is transmitted over the internet using TCP sockets.
- <b>Socket Programming</b>: Understanding how to create, bind, listen on, accept, connect to, read from, and write to sockets in C programming.
- <b>Error Handling and Recovery</b>: Strategies for detecting, reporting, and recovering from errors in network communication, including graceful shutdowns and error logging.
- <b>Testing and debugging</b>

<h3 align="left">If I had to do it all over again ðŸ—’</h3>

- I would create a User class rather than a structure in the server class.
- I would optimize the use of the abstract class ACommand.
- I would group together all error and reply definitions in a .hpp file.
